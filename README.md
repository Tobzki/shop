Code test where I built a webshop fetching different kind of items. You can buy an item or click on a specific one to fetch the unique information about that specific product. Focus was on the technique and no styling!

Tech stack:

React Router
Fetch
React Hooks
UseContext for state management
.sort, .map, .reduce methods
Conditional rendering

To fire it up you can clone the project and do NPM Install followed up with NPM start. Then a local server should start at port 3000 :)
